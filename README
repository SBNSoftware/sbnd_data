`sbnd_data` package
=====================

`sbnd_data` contains small data files for SBND processing.

On each modification, the `CHANGES` file should be updated to document the changes.

The content is:
* `GENIE/`: contains configurations for dirt simulation
* `ParticleGunHists/`: particle gun input histograms
* `Response/`: signal shape on the wires ("electric field response")
* `FlashMatch/`: contains flash matching metric files
* `OpDetSim/`: contains digi_arapuca_sbnd.root and digi_pmt_sbnd.root files
* `SCEoffsets/`: Contains space charge offsets
* `PandoraMVAs/`: Trained MVA configurations for Pandora
* `OpticalLibrary/`: photon library files (for hybrid light simulation)
* `ShowerEnergyReco/`: contains files for shower energy reconstruction
* `CRUMBS/`: contains BDT weights for CRUMBS cosmic rejection tool
* `OpDetReco/`: contains files for light signal reconstruction
* `WireCell/`: contains files for wirecell simulation, signal processing, and reconstruction
* `CNNHitClassification/`: contains weights for CNN hit classification
* `CVN/`: contains model for CVN neutrino flavor classification
* `WireMod/`: contains spline files for WireMod systematics
* `README`: a short description of the content of the package; it is in Markdown format, because why not _(this file)_
* `CHANGES`: a list of the changes to the content: **please update this whenever you change the content!** This is the only way we have to track it.
* `ups/`: contains the magics for this to be a legit UPS product; usually no need to change it

General documentation of this package is in SBND wiki at: https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/sbndcode/wiki/Small_data_files_for_SBND_processing_sbnd_data .

Usage
------

The package is set up in the usual UPS way.
Only the base directory is added to the `FW_SEARCH_PATH` list: your configuration will have to specify the full relative path to a file.
